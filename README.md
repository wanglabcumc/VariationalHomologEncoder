# VariationalHomologEncoder
Repo for the ICML 2018 Computational Biology Workshop paper, "The Variational Homolog Encoder".

Code is written in Tensorflow v1.2, seems to work fine with v1.4. Code should be compatible in both Python 2.7 and Python 3.

The model is intended to run with `python model.py`.

I wanted to get this up in time for the conference so code should all be here but is a little bit unorganized. It should be in a more "finished" state approximately one week after conference.

Thanks for your interest and leave any concerns in "Issues",
